Lottery investment Smart Contract was developed to secure investors' money. Investors send their ethers to the smart contract. Investors send their funds to DGGV (DG Global Ventures) smart contract and investment funds are sent to Lottery address (0x62Ef732Ec9BAB90070f4ac4e065Ce1CC090D909f) while administration fees are deducted.
