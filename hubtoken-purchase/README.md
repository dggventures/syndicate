Token purchasers send their ethers to the smart contract and the smart contract distribute the money within the same transaction. If the transaction fails, the money is not transfered. When it succeed, the ethers are transfered to Hub Token's address (0xcc04AF825eEf340e99710D4366e3021F8d82F42A) while administration fees are deducted.
