Token purchasers send their ethers to the smart contract and the smart contract distributes the money within the same transaction. If the transaction fails, the money is not transferred. When it succeeds, the ethers are transferred to Wibson2 Token's address (0x40AF356665E9E067139D6c0d135be2B607e01Ab3) while administration fees are deducted.
