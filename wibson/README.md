Investors send their ethers to the smart contract and the smart contract distribute the money within the same transaction. If the transaction fails, the money is not transfered. When it succeed, the ethers are transfered to Wibson's address (0xBe25379a36948DfC1a98CdB1Ec7eF155A8D3Fd81) while administration fees are deducted.

### Smart Contract Deployment

### Tokens

We will deploy a new smart contract after Wibson's smart contract is available to allow investors withdraw their tokens after the vesting periods end.
